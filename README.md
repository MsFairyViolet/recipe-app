# Recipe App

> A personal recipe application that helps store recipes, track ingredients and provide instructions.

## About

An application to keep track of your favorite recipes, with personalized information like calories, cuisine types, and ingredients. Built as a standalone solution, without the external need for depedencies or subscriptions.
It is designed to eventually expand into a meal planning tool with automatic grocery list generation.

I developed this project to advance my front-end development skills, focusing on React and modern web development practices. While I handled all the front-end development, I collaborated closely with a backend developer on database design and API architecture, giving me valuable insight into full-stack development workflows and cross-team collaboration.

## What I Learned

### Technical Skills
- **React**: Learned complex states for recipe data and useContext for confirmation dialogs
- **API Integration:** Learned to work with recipe APIs, handling data requests and transformation
- **UI & Design:** Implemented a clear but visually pleasing design, with expected visual feedback and functionality across elements
- **Responsive Design:** Made the application usable on different desktop and mobile devices

## Challenges Overcome
- **State Management:** Implementing confirmation dialogs across multiple components without prop drilling
- **API Design:** Collaborating on backend structure while learning how frontend needs translate to database design
- **Components:** Different custom and reusable components to be used throughout the application
- **Testing:** Learned how to do end-to-end testing and applied it to this project

# Getting Started

This project consists of a React frontend and Kotlin/Spring Boot backend with MySQL database.

**Local Setup:** 
This project uses a backend API and database configuration. The frontend can be run independently but needs the backend API for basic functionality.
Backend server in local development:
- Clears the database
- Seeds the database with example recipe data
- Provides API endpoints

For demonstration purposes, please view the screenshots above.

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (v18 or higher)
- Java 17
- MySQL
- Git

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/MsFairyViolet/recipe-app.git
   cd recipe-app
   ```

2. **Database Setup**
   ```bash
   # Create MySQL database and user
   mysql -u root -p
   CREATE DATABASE recipes;
   CREATE USER 'recipes'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'your_password';
   GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON recipes.* TO 'recipes'@'localhost';
   ```

3. **Backend Configuration**
```bash
   # Configure application properties
   cd recipe-app-back-end/src/main/resources/application-local.properties
   # Edit application-local.properties with your database credentials
```

5. **Install Dependencies**
