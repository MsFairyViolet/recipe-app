# Recipe App

> A personal recipe application that helps store recipes, track ingredients and provide instructions.

## About

An application to keep track of your favorite recipes, with personalized information like calories, cuisine types, and ingredients. Built as a standalone solution, without the external need for depedencies or subscriptions.
It is designed to eventually expand into a meal planning tool with automatic grocery list generation.

I developed this project to advance my front-end development skills, focusing on React and modern web development practices. While I handled all the front-end development, I collaborated closely with a backend developer on database design and API architecture, giving me valuable insight into full-stack development workflows and cross-team collaboration.
