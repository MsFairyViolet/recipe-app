# Recipe App

> A personal recipe application that helps store recipes, track ingredients and provide instructions.

## About

An application to keep track of your favorite recipes, with personalized information like calories, cuisine types, and ingredients. Built as a standalone solution, without the external need for depedencies or subscriptions.
It is designed to eventually expand into a meal planning tool with automatic grocery list generation.

I developed this project to advance my front-end development skills, focusing on React and modern web development practices. While I handled all the front-end development, I collaborated closely with a backend developer on database design and API architecture, giving me valuable insight into full-stack development workflows and cross-team collaboration.

## What I Learned

### Technical Skills
- **React**: Learned complex states for recipe data and useContext for confirmation dialogs
- **API Integration:** Learned to work with recipe APIs, handling data requests and transformation
- **UI & Design:** Implemented a clear but visually pleasing design, with expected visual feedback and functionality across elements
- **Responsive Design:** Made the application usable on different desktop and mobile devices

## Challenges Overcome
- **State Management:** Implementing confirmation dialogs across multiple components without prop drilling
- **API Design:** Collaborating on backend structure while learning how frontend needs translate to database design
- **Components:** Different custom and reusable components to be used throughout the application
- **Testing:** Learned how to do end-to-end testing and applied it to this project

## Future Enhancements

# Getting Started

This project consists of a React frontend and Kotlin/Spring Boot backend with MySQL database.

**‚ö†Ô∏è Local Setup Limitations:** 
This project uses a custom backend API and private database configuration. The frontend can be run independently but would miss the basic functionality of the backend API.
Full local setup requires:
- Specific server configuration
- Database with recipe data
- API keys and authentication setup
For demonstration purposes, please view the screenshots above.

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (v18 or higher) - [Download](https://nodejs.org/)
- Java 17 - [Download](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/)
- MySQL - [Download](https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/installer/)
- Git - [Download](https://git-scm.com/download)

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/recipe-app.git
   cd recipe-app
   ```

2. **Database Setup**
   ```bash
   # Create MySQL database and user
   mysql -u root -p
   CREATE DATABASE recipe_app;
   CREATE USER 'recipe_user'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'your_password';
   GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON recipe_app.* TO 'recipe_user'@'localhost';
   ```

3. **Backend Configuration**
   ```bash
   # Copy and configure application properties
   cp src/main/resources/application.example.properties src/main/resources/application.properties
   # Edit application.properties with your database credentials
   ```

4. **Install Dependencies**
   ```bash
   # Frontend dependencies
   npm install
   
   # Backend dependencies are managed by Gradle
   ```

### Running the Application
